# anime
a simple gui made to keep track of your anime. 100% in python.
an anime list tracker, of sorts.

# instructions
this is a pretty straightforward gui. There are 5 main elements to this:
- the checkbox area
- the info screen
- the searchbar
- the filters
- the add button

The checkbox area: by default shows all anime (when opening the app). It is used to check off anime.

Info screen: pops on when you hover on an anime for about 175 ms (or supposed to). It can cause lag on lower end devices. I havent optimized yet

Search bar: type in a name of an anime and it filters the anime you have. Based on the dropdown next to it. Pressing enter shows top 10 anime which matches the name. Searches for the matching anime, NOT in your list. select anime that pops up and press the add button that pops up next to the dropdown menu.

Filters: next to the search bar. can be used to filter anime with following [Name, Genre, Watched, Unwatched]
- name: type an anime name in the search bar (ex: frieren)
- genre: type a genre and filters anime that matches. (ex: adventure) currently only supports ONE genre tag.
- watched and unwatched: pretty straightforward. Filters between watched and unwatched. Should be able to search anime name as well. forgot to test that.

Add button: select anime from the "enter" state. ("enter" state is when you search for an anime with the search bar and press enter). Adds only the selected anime.
